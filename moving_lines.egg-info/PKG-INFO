Description: # flight_planning
        Collection of python codes for use with flight planning software
        
        Currently interfaces a basemap with and excel spreadsheet
        Makes clickable points in the basemap reflected in the excel spreadsheet
        
        The main script to run the program is moving_lines_v3.py. 
        This creates a gui with basemap, and a set of buttons.
        
        Button functions are handled by gui.py. 
        The functions for the Basemap instance and its interactivity are handled by map_interactive.py
        The functions for interfacing with Excel is handled by excel_interface.py
        
        To do:
        - add other forecast imagery from GMAO or others using WMS
        - make more accurate flight time calculations (accounting for climbing and descending)
        - add current AOD values at AERONET stations
        - add ship tracks, or position of ships
        - add calipso ground track
        - add capabilities to load hdf files and put contour as background
        - add remove flight button
        
        Known Bugs:
        - Sometime slow starting up
        - Slow when loading excel file
        - Altitude may not always change adequatly, even after manual input
        - delaytime may be modified, even after manual input
        - when switching between flight paths, speed may be mixed up
